title: "What the EAT-Lancet recommendations (do not) say about milk"
---

The Planetary Health Diet (PHD) is the flagship output of the EAT-Lancet Commission, and has gained widespread endorsement, from academia to industry and from NGOs to governmental food authorities1. Most people know it as the sustainable diet, able to feed a growing global population in a healthy way. The food system is responsible for 30% of global greenhouse gas emissions and constitutes the dominant driver behind biodiversity collapse, water pollution and a range of other planetary safety issues. To many, the PHD is seen as clear guidance on what to eat to stay within planetary boundaries.
