title: About this blog
---

I blog about the food system and the climate crisis. I blog to make sense of this fascinating, wide-ranging issue, and to give a home to the many diversions and technicalities that I encounter in my job as a researcher for Milieudefensie (Friends of the Earth Netherlands).

Blogposts are not necessarily the exact position of Milieudefensie. I am a human, who makes mistakes and omissions. Feel free to point me to these.
