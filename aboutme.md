I am Niels Debonne, a Food and Agriculture researcher and policy officer for Milieudefensie (Friends of the Earth Netherlands). This blog provides a home for deep-dives, technical details, side-tracks and other material that I find fascinating.

### My story

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just watch [my movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29) and it will answer **all** your questions.
