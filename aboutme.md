title: About this blog

I blog about the food system and the climate crisis. I blog to make sense of this fascinating, wide-ranging issue, and to give a home to the many diversions and technicalities that I encounter in my job as a researcher for Milieudefensie (Friends of the Earth Netherlands).

Blogposts are not necessarily the exact position of Milieudefensie. I am a human, who makes mistakes and omissions. Feel free to point me to these. 

**About me**
I finished a [PhD](https://research.vu.nl/ws/portalfiles/portal/121567975/N%20%20Debonne%20-%20thesis.pdf) on how the shifting of power in global agriculture is changing land use and sustainability at VU Amsterdam. After that, I stuck around at the university, doing a postdoc on the sustainability of European agriculture, and then becoming an assistant professor. 
In my work as a scientist, I was confronted by the urgency and injustices of the climate crisis. I took an active role in the climate movement, at first by [organizing fellow scientists](https://www.scientistrebellion.nl/index.php/en/scientist-rebellion-nederland-english/). 
After some time, I switched careers to focus entirely on food, agriculture, and the climate crisis. In my current work at Milieudefensie, I work to hold agribusinesses and food giants accountable for their climate impacts.
